❖ **INTRODUCTION :**

Real estate is a type of business for selling, buying, renting land, buildings and offices.

Real estate agencies duties include, to give the property on rent or else to sell the

property. Properties like building, retail sites, flats, houses, bungalows etc. Many people

search for property for many purposes like residence, offices, faculty and etc. Every

individual wants his house to be in the best location with best facilities. Offices should be

near market area in order to increase sales and productivity. The manual real estate

agency follows a lengthy and hectic process. People need to meet the agent in person,
